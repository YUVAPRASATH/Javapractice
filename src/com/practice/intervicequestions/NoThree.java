/*
John has a fascination with numbers, but he feels that the number 3 is unlucky.
Given a number N as input finds the largest number less than or equal to N which do not contain the unlucky digit 3.
Input
An integer N which is less than 1,000,000
Output
An integer is less than or equal to N, which does not contain the unlucky digit 3.
For example:
If the input number is 1248 then this number doesnâ€™t contain digit 3, and hence, the output would be the same number i.e. 1248.
If the input number is 1234 then this number contains digit 3 and we will decrement this input number by 1 in each iteration till we reach the number 1229 which follows the desired condition.
